Repository for a collection of deep learning tutorials and scripts on image data.

When running for the first time, you need to set up a virtualenv:
`virtualenv theano`

To activate the environment, `. bin/activate`.

Then, `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`

Note that to install pycurl on Mac OSX, the command 
`sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" pip install pycurl` was used to install pycurl
globally.
